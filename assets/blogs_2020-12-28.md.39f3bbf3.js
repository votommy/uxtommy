After hunting for 3 months, I finally landed a job in September. With this new source of income, I finally had a reason to start tracking my finances. <br data-v-147b3a24><br data-v-147b3a24> One monumental event happened this year \u2014 my net worth went into the positive for the first time since college!

My net worth is increasing by ~$3,500/month. My goal right now is to pay off all my debt before it has a chance to accrue interest. If I do, it&#39;ll mean that I borrowed money for school interest free! I think it&#39;s more than doable, given my current trajectory. <br data-v-147b3a24><br data-v-147b3a24> Let&#39;s see what 2021 has in store. <br data-v-147b3a24><br data-v-147b3a24><br data-v-147b3a24> - Tommy </p>',5),u={key:0,id:"tags"},p={id:"tagPills"};function f(_,g,v,T,n,y){return t(),e("div",null,[h,(t(!0),e(o,null,s(n.blogs,a=>(t(),e("div",null,[a.basename=="2020-12-28"?(t(),e("span",u,[(t(!0),e(o,null,s(a.tags,i=>(t(),e("span",p,d(i),1))),256))])):c("",!0)]))),256))])}const M=r(b,[["render",f],["__scopeId","data-v-147b3a24"]]);export{D as __pageData,M as default};
