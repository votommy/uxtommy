After hunting for 3 months, I finally landed a job in September. With this new source of income, I finally had a reason to start tracking my finances. <br data-v-69742841><br data-v-69742841> One monumental event happened this year \u2014 my net worth went into the positive for the first time since college!

My net worth is increasing by ~$3,500/month. My goal right now is to pay off all my debt before it has a chance to accumulate any interest. This&#39;ll mean that I borrowed money for school interest free! I think it&#39;s more than doable, given my current trajectory. <br data-v-69742841><br data-v-69742841> Let&#39;s see what 2021 has in store. <br data-v-69742841><br data-v-69742841><br data-v-69742841> - Tommy </p>',5),u={key:0,id:"tags"},_={id:"tagPills"};function b(f,v,y,g,s,w){return t(),e("div",null,[p,(t(!0),e(n,null,o(s.blogs,a=>(t(),e("div",null,[a.basename=="2020-12-28"?(t(),e("span",u,[(t(!0),e(n,null,o(a.tags,r=>(t(),e("span",_,d(r),1))),256))])):c("",!0)]))),256))])}const M=i(h,[["render",b],["__scopeId","data-v-69742841"]]);export{D as __pageData,M as default};
