After only 8 months, I decided that my mental health was worth more than the stable income I was making there. To make matters worse, my car broke down during the silicon shortage. Because supply wasn&#39;t meeting demand, used cars with 20k miles on them were selling for more than brand new cars straight out the factory. So I had no choice but to do it; I cashed out on all my Dogecoin and used it towards the down-payment on a 2021 Corolla Hatchback. It&#39;s a pretty cool car, but I wish I could&#39;ve bought a used car for half that price. <br data-v-b1e2e394><br data-v-b1e2e394> I really foreshadowed this in my last update, didn&#39;t I?
