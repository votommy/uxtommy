After only 8 months, I decided that my mental health was worth more than the stable income I was making there. To make matters worse, my car broke down during the silicon shortage. Used cars with 20k miles on them were selling for more than brand new cars straight out the factory. So I had no choice but to do it; I cashed out on all my Dogecoin and used it towards the down-payment on a 2021 Corolla Hatchback. It&#39;s a pretty cool car, but I wish I could&#39;ve bought a used car for half that price. <br data-v-74b9a1e3><br data-v-74b9a1e3> I really foreshadowed this in my last update, didn&#39;t I?
