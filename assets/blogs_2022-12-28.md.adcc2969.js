I spent well over a year unemployed, searching for the perfect job. <br data-v-51f9fd9a> I&#39;m happy to say I found that job. After 1 year &amp; 5 months living off my savings, I finally landed a job at a company that I&#39;m confident I want to stay at. It&#39;s a remote job, which means I can work from anywhere in the world; so I thought, &quot;Why not the most exciting city in the country?&quot;. <br data-v-51f9fd9a> I packed all of my belongings into my car and drove to Las Vegas where I plan to spend the rest of my life. <br data-v-51f9fd9a> So, let&#39;s talk about it. <br data-v-51f9fd9a><br data-v-51f9fd9a> Moving to Vegas was the best decision I&#39;ve ever made, and it was entirely made possible by the new job I got. Not only is the job remote, but the company is based out of California, which means I get paid a California salary without the California cost-of-living. <br data-v-51f9fd9a> Unfortunately, I have to reside in an apartment for the next few years until I&#39;ve built a long enough work history to apply for a mortgage. Since I was unemployed for the past year, I essentially have no work history, so this new job will be the beginning of it. In order to even be considered for a mortgage, one needs at least 2 years of tax returns as proof of a steady income. The earliest I can start shopping for a house is 2 years from now. This gives me time to build my savings so I can have a substantial down-payment on the house I end up buying. <br data-v-51f9fd9a><br data-v-51f9fd9a> I think I ended this year much more positively than the last. I have no wishes for the next year other than to continue working at this dream job of mine while I experience Sin City for what it is. Who knows, maybe by the end of next year, the excitement of the city will subside, and I can consider moving to a calmer area within Nevada. <br data-v-51f9fd9a><br data-v-51f9fd9a><br data-v-51f9fd9a> - Tommy </p>',5),u={key:0,id:"tags"},p={id:"tagPills"};function v(y,b,g,_,s,w){return t(),e("div",null,[m,(t(!0),e(o,null,n(s.blogs,a=>(t(),e("div",null,[a.basename=="2022-12-28"?(t(),e("span",u,[(t(!0),e(o,null,n(a.tags,i=>(t(),e("span",p,l(i),1))),256))])):f("",!0)]))),256))])}const D=r(c,[["render",v],["__scopeId","data-v-51f9fd9a"]]);export{T as __pageData,D as default};
