I have a steady job, with my own place, and no drama or setbacks. This update will be very boring as nothing really happened, but that&#39;s not necessarily bad. In fact, it&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve felt at ease in a long time. <br data-v-905e3993> So, let&#39;s talk about what went well, along with some things that are of concern. <br data-v-905e3993><br data-v-905e3993> I started the year with a net worth of ~$25k and grew it to ~$70k; that&#39;s a growth of over $46k. I was able to do this by investing half of my paychecks immediately as they come in. <br data-v-905e3993> Currently, my goal is to build up enough money for a house here in Nevada. I&#39;ve actually been eyeing the real estate market just to stay in touch with the state of the market. It does not look good. With record high interest rates, even with a perfect credit score, it&#39;s ridiculously high. Even with that in mind, I still want to buy a house as soon as possible. I could always refinance when the market is better, so I&#39;d rather prioritize locking in the price of the house itself. <br data-v-905e3993><br data-v-905e3993> Unfortunately, it&#39;ll be at least 2 years before I have enough for a down-payment. My goal is to put at least 20% down. Until then, my plan is to simply continue doing what I&#39;ve been doing. <br data-v-905e3993><br data-v-905e3993><br data-v-905e3993> - Tommy </p>',5),p={key:0,id:"tags"},g={id:"tagPills"};function v(b,f,T,y,o,_){return t(),e("div",null,[u,(t(!0),e(s,null,i(o.blogs,a=>(t(),e("div",null,[a.basename=="2023-12-28"?(t(),e("span",p,[(t(!0),e(s,null,i(a.tags,n=>(t(),e("span",g,d(n),1))),256))])):h("",!0)]))),256))])}const I=r(m,[["render",v],["__scopeId","data-v-905e3993"]]);export{D as __pageData,I as default};
