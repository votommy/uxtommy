I have a steady job, with my own place, and no drama or setbacks. This update will be very boring as nothing really happened, but that&#39;s not necessarily bad. In fact, it&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve felt at ease in a long time. <br data-v-a9f03d77> So, let&#39;s talk about what went well, along with some things that are of concern. <br data-v-a9f03d77><br data-v-a9f03d77> I started the year with a net worth of ~$25k and grew it to ~$70k; that&#39;s a growth of over $46k. I was able to do this by investing half of my paychecks immediately as they come in. <br data-v-a9f03d77> Currently, my goal is to build up enough money for a house here in Nevada. I&#39;ve actually been eyeing the real estate market just to stay in touch with the state of the market. It does not look good. With record high interest rates, even with a perfect credit score, it&#39;s ridiculously high. Even with that in mind, I still want to buy a house as soon as possible. I could always refinance when the market is better, so I&#39;d rather prioritize locking in the price of the house itself. <br data-v-a9f03d77><br data-v-a9f03d77> Unfortunately, it&#39;ll be at least 2 years before I have enough for a down-payment. My goal is to put at least 20% down. Until then, my plan is to simply continue doing what I&#39;ve been doing. <br data-v-a9f03d77><br data-v-a9f03d77><br data-v-a9f03d77> - Tommy </p>',5),u={key:0,id:"tags"},p={id:"tagPills"};function v(g,b,_,y,o,w){return t(),e("div",null,[m,(t(!0),e(s,null,i(o.blogs,a=>(t(),e("div",null,[a.basename=="2023-12-28"?(t(),e("span",u,[(t(!0),e(s,null,i(a.tags,n=>(t(),e("span",p,l(n),1))),256))])):h("",!0)]))),256))])}const I=r(f,[["render",v],["__scopeId","data-v-a9f03d77"]]);export{D as __pageData,I as default};
