For the first time, we see Earth as a planet - no colorcoded countries, drawn borders, or visibly separated nations - just Earth the way it was meant to be seen. This photo changed the way humanity viewed our world, and there couldn't have been a better time for us to see it. When conflicts between nations were elevated, during the deadliest year of the Vietnam War, we were shown a beautiful world without territories or borders: OUR world. We were shown that we're all in this together as a single entity floating through the vastness of space, and it brought a sense of unity that we've never felt before. This lit a fire under our asses to get our shit together. Just a year later, 1969, we walked on the moon. T'was the first time we took a step back to glance at our planet with our own eyes and saw it in its entirety. Just one year after that, 1970, Earth Day was founded and we started to actually care about our planet.
