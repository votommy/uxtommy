With this new source of income, I finally had a reason to start tracking my finances. <br data-v-25c36ec9><br data-v-25c36ec9> One monumental event happened this year \u2014 my net worth went into the positive for the first time since college!

My net worth is increasing by ~$3,500/month. My goal right now is to pay off all my debt before it has a chance to accumulate any interest. This&#39;ll mean that I borrowed money for school interest free! I think it&#39;s more than doable, given my current trajectory. <br data-v-25c36ec9><br data-v-25c36ec9> Let&#39;s see what 2021 has in store. <br data-v-25c36ec9><br data-v-25c36ec9><br data-v-25c36ec9> - Tommy </p>',4);function l(e,h,m,p,_,b){return s(),a("div",null,[o("h1",null,n(e.$frontmatter.titleTemplate),1),d])}const v=t(i,[["render",l],["__scopeId","data-v-25c36ec9"]]);export{y as __pageData,v as default};
