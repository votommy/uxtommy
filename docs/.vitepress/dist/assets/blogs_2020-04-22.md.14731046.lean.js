This photo changed the way humanity viewed our world, and there couldn't have been a better time for us to see it. When conflicts between nations were elevated, during the deadliest year of the Vietnam War, we were shown a beautiful world without territories or borders, OUR world. We were shown that we're all in this together as a single entity floating through the vastness of space, and it brought a sense of unity that we've never felt before. This lit a fire under our asses to get our shit together. Just a year later, 1969, we walked on the moon.
