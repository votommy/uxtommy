My net worth is increasing by ~$3,500/month. My goal right now is to pay off all my debt before it has a chance to accrue interest. If I do, it&#39;ll mean that I borrowed money for school interest free! I think it&#39;s more than doable, given my current trajectory, and the fact that there is a 6-month grace period on the loans during which interest does not accrue. <br data-v-2cf01c79><br data-v-2cf01c79> Let&#39;s see what 2021 has in store. <br data-v-2cf01c79><br data-v-2cf01c79><br data-v-2cf01c79> - Tommy </p>',5),u={key:0,id:"tags"},p={id:"tagPills"};function g(b,_,T,v,s,y){return t(),e("div",null,[f,(t(!0),e(o,null,n(s.blogs,a=>(t(),e("div",null,[a.basename=="2020-12-28"?(t(),e("span",u,[(t(!0),e(o,null,n(a.tags,i=>(t(),e("span",p,l(i),1))),256))])):d("",!0)]))),256))])}const M=r(h,[["render",g],["__scopeId","data-v-2cf01c79"]]);export{D as __pageData,M as default};
