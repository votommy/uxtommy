After hunting for 3 months, I finally landed a job in September. With this new source of income, I finally had a reason to start tracking my finances. <br data-v-75f03fab><br data-v-75f03fab> One monumental event happened this year \u2014 my net worth went into the positive for the first time since college! It probably won&#39;t stay above zero for long, but it&#39;s worth celebrating. <br data-v-75f03fab> I&#39;m still living with my parents, hence why I&#39;m able to pay off my loans so fast. My net worth is increasing by ~$3,500/month. My goal right now is to pay off all my debt before it has a chance to accumulate any interest. This&#39;ll mean that I borrowed money for school interest free! I think it&#39;s more than doable, given my current trajectory. <br data-v-75f03fab><br data-v-75f03fab> Let&#39;s see what 2021 has in store. <br data-v-75f03fab><br data-v-75f03fab><br data-v-75f03fab> - Tommy </p>',5),h={key:0,id:"tags"},u={id:"tagPills"};function p(_,v,y,g,o,w){return t(),e("div",null,[b,(t(!0),e(n,null,s(o.blogs,a=>(t(),e("div",null,[a.basename=="2020-12-28"?(t(),e("span",h,[(t(!0),e(n,null,s(a.tags,r=>(t(),e("span",u,f(r),1))),256))])):d("",!0)]))),256))])}const M=i(m,[["render",p],["__scopeId","data-v-75f03fab"]]);export{D as __pageData,M as default};
