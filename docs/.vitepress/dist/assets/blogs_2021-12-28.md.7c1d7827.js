After only 8 months, I decided that my mental health was worth more than the stable income I was making there. To make matters worse, my car broke down during the silicon shortage. Because supply wasn&#39;t meeting demand, used car prices skyrocketed to the same price as brand new cars. Since my local dealership had an agreement with the manufacturer to cap the new car prices at MSRP, it made the most sense to buy the new car rather than a used one that would&#39;ve costed the same amount. So I had no choice but to do it; I cashed out on all my Dogecoin and used it towards the down-payment on a 2021 Corolla Hatchback. It&#39;s a pretty nice car, but I wish I could&#39;ve bought a used car for half that price. <br data-v-ca308ffb><br data-v-ca308ffb> I really foreshadowed this in my last update?
