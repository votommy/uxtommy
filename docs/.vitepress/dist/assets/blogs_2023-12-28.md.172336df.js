I have a steady job, with my own place, and no drama or setbacks. This update will be very boring as nothing really happened, but that&#39;s not necessarily bad. In fact, it&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve felt at ease in a long time. <br data-v-34ec910a> So, let&#39;s talk about what went well, along with some things that are of concern. <br data-v-34ec910a><br data-v-34ec910a> I started the year with a net worth of $25k and grew it to $70k; that&#39;s a growth of over $46k. I was able to do this by investing half of my paychecks immediately as they come in. <br data-v-34ec910a> Currently, my goal is to build up enough money for a house here in Nevada. This goal will require, at the very least 5 years, to complete. I&#39;ve actually been eyeing the real estate market just to stay in touch with the state of the market. It does not look good. With record high interest rates, even with a perfect credit score, it still wouldn&#39;t be worth taking a mortgage right now. I&#39;ve actually been contemplating just continuing to rent until I have enough to buy a house in cash. I crunched the numbers and it&#39;s actually the cheaper option. Even factoring in the total cost of all the rent payments across the years, it&#39;d still be less than the amount of interest I&#39;d be payment throughout the mortgage. <br data-v-34ec910a> The unfortunate part is this will greatly delay when I can finally have my own home without shared walls. I want to be able to play my music loudly without bothering my neighbors. Another thing I so badly want is my own garage. I&#39;ve been holding onto a motorcycle permit for so many years now, but I can&#39;t buy a motorcycle until I have a garage to park it in. <br data-v-34ec910a> These are goals that I won&#39;t be able to achieve until at least the year 2030. Until then, I&#39;ll simply save and invest. <br data-v-34ec910a><br data-v-34ec910a> I have a feeling this year will be the start of a series of updates that look identical to each other. I don&#39;t have any big plans for the next 5 years. It&#39;ll literally be a steady growth until I buy a house. Unless the interest rates go down, this is my trajectory. <br data-v-34ec910a><br data-v-34ec910a><br data-v-34ec910a> - Tommy </p>',5),g={key:0,id:"tags"},y={id:"tagPills"};function b(p,v,w,f,n,_){return t(),e("div",null,[m,(t(!0),e(s,null,o(n.blogs,a=>(t(),e("div",null,[a.basename=="2023-12-28"?(t(),e("span",g,[(t(!0),e(s,null,o(a.tags,i=>(t(),e("span",y,c(i),1))),256))])):d("",!0)]))),256))])}const D=r(u,[["render",b],["__scopeId","data-v-34ec910a"]]);export{I as __pageData,D as default};
