I&#39;m starting to see the payoff of it. Although, the &quot;slowly&quot; part can be discouraging at times. <br data-v-4531530a><br data-v-4531530a> I still have the goal of buying a house by end of 2025. I&#39;ve even started taking steps towards it by easing off on investments, and putting my money into a high-yield savings account instead. This does 2 things: it minimizes my risk by guaranteeing a return, and it also minimizes my taxes when I cash out on my investments to put towards the down payment. By halting investments 1 year before I buy a house, I will only have to pay long-term capital gains tax on the stocks I sell. <br data-v-4531530a><br data-v-4531530a> My apartment lease ends in October 2025, so I&#39;ll need to house-hunt at least 3 months before that. Sadly, no matter how aggressively I save, that&#39;s not enough time for me to accumulate enough for a 20% down payment. My options are to rent for a few additional months, or buy a house with less than 20% down, and pay PMI. I&#39;m leaning towards the latter option. I&#39;d only need to pay PMI for a few months until I&#39;ve built enough equity, and it&#39;ll be cheaper than renting month-by-month. <br data-v-4531530a><br data-v-4531530a> If all goes well, my next update will be as a new homeowner. But worst case scenario, I have a bunch of cash piled up so that I&#39;ll be ready to make a purchase as soon as the perfect house comes up. I&#39;m very optimistic though. With my 800+ credit score, I should have no problems at all getting a mortgage. My only worry is either not finding the perfect house, or being out-bidded on the perfect house. We&#39;ll see how it goes. <br data-v-4531530a><br data-v-4531530a><br data-v-4531530a> - Tommy </p>',5),p={key:0,id:"tags"},g={id:"tagPills"};function y(f,b,v,_,n,w){return t(),e("div",null,[m,(t(!0),e(s,null,o(n.blogs,a=>(t(),e("div",null,[a.basename=="2024-12-28"?(t(),e("span",p,[(t(!0),e(s,null,o(a.tags,i=>(t(),e("span",g,d(i),1))),256))])):c("",!0)]))),256))])}const I=r(u,[["render",y],["__scopeId","data-v-4531530a"]]);export{D as __pageData,I as default};
