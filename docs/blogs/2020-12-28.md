<p>
    This post marks the start of my bookkeeping journey to track my net worth.
    <br><br>
    For some context around this time of my life — I graduated in May with a CS degree, almost $9k in debt, and no job lined up. After hunting for 3 months, I finally landed a job in September. With this new source of income, I finally had a reason to start tracking my finances.
    <br><br>
    One monumental event happened this year — my net worth went into the positive for the first time since college! It probably won't stay above zero for long, but it's worth celebrating.
    <br>
    I'm still living with my parents, hence why I'm able to pay off my loans so fast. My net worth is increasing by ~$3,500/month. My goal right now is to pay off all my debt before it has a chance to accumulate any interest. This'll mean that I borrowed money for school interest free! I think it's more than doable, given my current trajectory.
    <br><br>
    Let's see what 2021 has in store.
